# Meetingium

Meetingium is a wordpress plugin to manage **BigBlueButton** meetings & sell theme as a product with woocommerce.


## Development
- It's better to use "[Query Monitor](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/)" For logs.
    - If you don't want to use this plugin you should add ```define("WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY", true);``` to your **wp_config.php** file;
